The Keras package provides [utilities to work with numerous datasets](https://keras.io/datasets/), but we'll avoid those here (to limit needless network traffic).

    "> Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are mathematical questions defined as a set of objects whose state must satisfy a number of constraints or limitations. CSPs represent the entities in a problem as a homogeneous collection of finite constraints over variables, which is solved by constraint satisfaction methods. CSPs are the subject of intense research in both artificial intelligence and operations research, since the regularity in their formulation provides a common basis to analyze and solve problems of many seemingly unrelated families. CSPs often exhibit high complexity, requiring a combination of heuristics and combinatorial search methods to be solved in a reasonable time. The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), the satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) and answer set programming (ASP) can be roughly thought of as certain forms of the constraint satisfaction problem."

The backtracking algorithm traverses this search tree recursively in a depth-first order. At each node, the algorithm checks for a valid solution. If the current node cannot be completed to a valid solution, the whole subtree rooted at the current node is pruned. Otherwise, the algorithm recursively enumerates all subtrees of from the current node.\n",

    "An example of a more useful problem one can solve using backtracking is the *flight itinerary problem*. In this problem, you are given a set of tuples of the form *(origin, destination)* where each ordinate in the tuple is an airport code. A starting airport is specifed, but the set of tuples is otherwise not provided in any particular sequence. The goal is to use the list of tuples (flights) provided to recover the sequence of airports visited in sequence making sure to exhaust every tuple in the set provided. Of course, this can be considered a graph teraversal problem where the nodes/vertices are the airports and the edges are the connecting flights.\n",
